# Alfred @ Home

Alfred is a personal project I started a year ago. The first idea was "How rethink the New Tab page to be really useful ?". And after a year of experimentations, few elements stay and growth.

/!\ Perfectly adapt for a 13" MacBook Pro, not really for the other screens /!\

###Imgur
  Maybe not the most useful, but certainly the most use, It's basically the 20 most rated pictures of Imgur in the same place. By this way I'm avoiding spending hours on Imgur, watching all the pictures.
